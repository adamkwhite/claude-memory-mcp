# Test Execution Guide: Claude Conversation Memory MCP Server

## Overview

This guide provides a structured approach to testing your Claude Conversation Memory MCP Server using both exploratory session-based testing and structured test procedures. The testing is designed to focus on your high-priority risks (security and compatibility) while providing comprehensive coverage in ~6 hours total effort.

**Charter:** Use Session 1 from `session-charters.md`  

**Pre-session Setup (10 min):**
1. Backup current conversation data: `cp -r ~/claude-memory ~/claude-memory-backup`
2. Prepare test environment with monitoring
3. Review security test cases in `structured-tests/security-tests.md`

**Session Execution (70 min):**

- Explore error handling and recovery

**Post-session (5 min):**
- Document integration status
- Note any compatibility issues

### Phase 2: Functional Validation (2.5 hours)

#### Week 1, Day 3: Core Functionality Session
**Duration:** 90 minutes  
**Charter:** Use Session 3 from `session-charters.md`

**Focus Areas:**
- Search accuracy and relevance
- Conversation storage and indexing  
- Weekly summary generation
- Data persistence and integrity

**Testing Approach:**
- Use exploratory charter as guide
- Reference functional tests for specific scenarios
- Test realistic user workflows

#### Week 1, Day 4: Edge Cases Session
**Duration:** 60 minutes  
**Charter:** Use Session 4 from `session-charters.md`

**Focus Areas:**
- Boundary conditions and error handling
- Malformed inputs and recovery
- File system error scenarios
- Data corruption resistance

### Phase 3: Performance Validation (1 hour)

#### Week 1, Day 5: Performance Session (Optional)
**Duration:** 60 minutes  
**Charter:** Use Session 5 from `session-charters.md`

**Focus Areas:**
- Response time under load
- Memory usage patterns
- Scalability limits
- Concurrent operation handling

## How to Use the Testing Materials

### Exploratory Sessions (Primary Approach)

**Session Preparation:**
1. Read the charter from `session-charters.md`
2. Set up test environment as specified
3. Prepare session sheet from `session-templates.md`
4. Time-box the session (use timer)

**During Session:**
1. Follow charter mission as primary guide
2. Take notes in session sheet as you test
3. Follow interesting bugs even if off-charter
4. Apply multiple test techniques (function, risk, domain, etc.)
5. Document bugs and issues as you find them

**After Session:**
1. Complete session sheet within 10 minutes
2. Use debrief checklist to validate session quality
3. File formal bug reports for significant issues
4. Plan follow-up sessions based on findings

### Structured Tests (Supporting Approach)

**When to Use:**
- Need systematic coverage of specific areas
- Want repeatable test procedures
- Investigating specific bugs found during exploratory sessions
- Need detailed security or integration validation

**How to Execute:**
1. Choose appropriate test suite based on current focus
2. Follow step-by-step procedures
3. Document results in test suite or session notes
4. Use structured results to inform exploratory testing

### Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

**Combine Both Methods:**
- Start sessions with exploratory charter
- Use structured tests when you need specific coverage
- Reference structured tests during exploratory work
- Document everything in session sheets

## Test Environment Setup

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Backup existing data
cp -r ~/claude-memory ~/claude-memory-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Verify environment
cd ~/Code/claude-memory-mcp
python --version
pip list | grep fastmcp
ls -la ~/claude-memory/

# Start MCP server
python server_fastmcp.py
```

### Test Data Preparation
```bash
# Create test conversation samples
mkdir -p ~/test-data/conversations
# Use add_conversation tool to create known test data
# Or prepare sample conversations in advance
```

### Monitoring Setup
```bash
# Monitor file system during testing
tail -f ~/claude-memory-mcp/mcp-server.log &

# Check resource usage
htop  # or top for system monitoring
```

## Getting Help During Testing

### When Stuck
1. Take a 5-minute break and review charter
2. Try a different test technique from the strategy
3. Reference structured tests for systematic approaches
4. Use PROOF debrief agenda to think through the session

### Documentation Issues
1. Better to have incomplete but honest notes than perfect fiction
2. Use bullet points and keywords during active testing
3. Expand notes immediately after session
4. Focus on what you actually did and observed

### Charter Problems
1. It's okay to change charter to match actual work done
2. Document charter changes in session notes
3. Create new charter for interesting areas discovered
4. Don't force artificial adherence to original charter
