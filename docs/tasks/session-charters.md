# Test Session Charters: Claude Conversation Memory MCP Server

## Session 1: Security & Data Protection 
**Priority: HIGH | Duration: 90 minutes**

### Charter
Explore the security characteristics of the conversation memory system, particularly around file handling, data exposure, and access controls, to identify vulnerabilities that could compromise personal conversation data.

### Areas to Test
- **File System Security**: Directory traversal, path injection, permission handling
- **Data Protection**: Information disclosure in logs, error messages, temporary files
- **Input Validation**: Malicious content handling, JSON injection attacks  
- **Storage Security**: File permissions, access controls, data visibility

### Setup
- Fresh MCP server installation
- Sample conversations with sensitive test data
- File system monitoring tools
- Log file access for error message review

### Key Risk Questions
- Can malicious file paths access system files outside storage directory?
- Do error messages or logs expose personal conversation content?
- Are stored files properly protected from unauthorized access?
- Can malformed input corrupt or expose index data?

### Test Strategy Tags
- **Risk Testing**: Security vulnerabilities
- **Claims Testing**: Security assertions in PRD
- **Domain Testing**: File path boundaries, input validation

## Session 2: FastMCP Integration & Compatibility
**Priority: CRITICAL | Duration: 60 minutes**

### Charter
Verify the FastMCP protocol implementation and Claude Desktop integration to ensure reliable tool discovery, execution, and error handling in the target environment.

### Areas to Test
- **MCP Protocol Compliance**: Tool signatures, parameter validation, response formats
- **Claude Desktop Integration**: Tool discovery, execution, result display
- **Error Handling**: Network failures, server restarts, invalid requests
- **Environment Compatibility**: WSL/Ubuntu environment, Python dependencies

### Setup
- Claude Desktop with MCP server configured
- Network monitoring for MCP communication
- Server restart capabilities
- Invalid parameter test cases

### Key Risk Questions
- Are all tools properly discovered and accessible in Claude Desktop?
- Do tool parameters validate correctly and provide helpful errors?
- How does the system handle server failures or restarts?
- Are responses formatted correctly for Claude Desktop display?

### Test Strategy Tags
- **Flow Testing**: End-to-end tool execution
- **Stress Testing**: Server restart scenarios
- **Claims Testing**: Integration requirements

## Session 3: Core Functionality Deep Dive
**Priority: MEDIUM | Duration: 90 minutes**

### Charter
Thoroughly exercise the three main tools (search, add, summarize) to verify correct functionality, data handling, and user workflows under normal operating conditions.

### Areas to Test
- **Search Functionality**: Query processing, relevance scoring, result formatting
- **Conversation Storage**: File creation, indexing, topic extraction
- **Weekly Summaries**: Date calculations, content analysis, output formatting
- **Data Persistence**: Index updates, file organization, topic tracking

### Setup
- Variety of test conversations (different topics, dates, sizes)
- Known search queries with expected results
- Multiple weeks of conversation data for summary testing
- Index file backup for recovery testing

### Key Risk Questions
- Do searches return relevant and accurate results?
- Are conversations stored and indexed correctly?
- Do weekly summaries provide useful insights?
- Is the file organization logical and sustainable?

### Test Strategy Tags
- **Function Testing**: Core capabilities
- **User Testing**: Realistic usage scenarios
- **Domain Testing**: Date ranges, content types

## Session 4: Edge Cases & Error Handling
**Priority: MEDIUM | Duration: 60 minutes**

### Charter
Explore boundary conditions, malformed inputs, and error scenarios to verify graceful failure handling and system resilience under adverse conditions.

### Areas to Test
- **Input Validation**: Empty queries, invalid dates, oversized content
- **File System Errors**: Permission denied, disk full, missing directories
- **Data Corruption**: Malformed JSON, missing index files, broken file links
- **Boundary Conditions**: Very large conversations, many search results

### Setup
- Controlled error scenarios (full disk simulation, permission changes)
- Malformed test data (invalid JSON, corrupted files)
- Boundary value test cases
- System resource monitoring

### Key Risk Questions
- How does the system handle invalid or missing inputs?
- Are error messages helpful and non-revealing of sensitive data?
- Can the system recover from index corruption or missing files?
- What happens at the limits of system capacity?

### Test Strategy Tags
- **Stress Testing**: Resource exhaustion scenarios
- **Risk Testing**: Error condition exploration
- **Domain Testing**: Boundary value analysis

## Session 5: Performance & Scale Testing
**Priority: LOW | Duration: 60 minutes**

### Charter
Evaluate system performance under realistic load conditions and identify potential scalability limitations for long-term usage.

### Areas to Test
- **Search Performance**: Response times with growing conversation datasets
- **Storage Efficiency**: File system usage, index size growth
- **Memory Usage**: Python process memory consumption during operations
- **Concurrent Operations**: Multiple simultaneous tool calls

### Setup
- Large dataset of conversations (100+ files)
- Performance monitoring tools
- Memory profiling capabilities
- Concurrent request simulation

### Key Risk Questions
- How does search performance degrade with more conversations?
- Are there memory leaks or resource accumulation issues?
- Can the system handle multiple simultaneous operations?
- What are the practical limits for dataset size?

### Test Strategy Tags
- **Stress Testing**: Performance under load
- **Flow Testing**: Sustained operation patterns
- **Tool-Supported Testing**: Automated performance measurement

## Charter Usage Notes

### Session Structure
Each session should follow this flow:
1. **Setup** (10-15 min): Environment preparation, test data loading
2. **Exploration** (60-75 min): Focused testing per charter
3. **Recording** (5-10 min): Session notes, bug reports, issues

### Charter Flexibility
- Charters are guidelines, not rigid scripts
- Follow interesting bugs or unexpected behavior
- Adjust scope based on findings
- Document any charter deviations in session notes

### Stopping Heuristics
- Time box expired (stay within session duration)
- Critical blocker found (security issue, integration failure)
- Charter objectives achieved
- Diminishing returns (no new insights being gained)

### Deliverables Per Session
- Session report following SBTM template
- Bug reports for any issues found
- Updated test data and scenarios for future use
- Risk assessment updates based on findings
