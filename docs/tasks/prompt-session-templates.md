# Prompt: Session-Based Test Management Templates

## Purpose
Generate Session-Based Test Management (SBTM) documentation templates for recording and managing exploratory testing sessions.

## Instructions
You are an expert in Session-Based Test Management methodology created by James Bach and Jonathan Bach. Generate templates that enable effective session recording, debriefing, and test management.

### Required Context
Before generating templates, understand:
1. **Testing Context** - Type of testing being performed (exploratory, investigative, etc.)
2. **Team Structure** - Solo tester vs. team, experience levels
3. **Project Requirements** - Formality level, documentation needs, reporting requirements
4. **Session Management** - Who will debrief sessions, how results will be tracked

### Templates to Generate

#### 1. Session Sheet Template
Core template for recording individual test sessions:

**Header Section:**
- Charter/Mission statement
- Session metadata (tester, date, duration, environment)
- Product version and test areas

**Task Breakdown (TBS Metrics):**
- Test Design and Execution percentage
- Bug Investigation and Reporting percentage  
- Session Setup percentage
- Charter vs. Opportunity testing ratio

**Session Content:**
- Data Files (test data used, artifacts created)
- Test Notes (coverage, oracles, activities, observations)
- Bugs (issues with the product)
- Issues (obstacles to testing)

**Session Summary:**
- Charter completion assessment
- Key findings and confidence level
- Follow-up recommendations

#### 2. Session Debrief Checklist
Quality validation checklist for session review:

**Charter Validation:**
- Charter text matches actual work performed
- Charter completion status and remaining work
- Documentation of any charter changes

**Session Data Quality:**
- Time allocation accuracy and reasonableness
- Task breakdown percentages add to 100%
- Proper categorization of activities

**Test Coverage and Notes:**
- Notes comprehensible and complete
- Coverage, oracles, and activities documented
- Test artifacts properly saved and referenced

**Bug and Issue Reporting:**
- Bug reports clear and actionable
- Issues (testing obstacles) documented separately
- Appropriate level of investigation performed

#### 3. PROOF Debrief Agenda
Structured agenda for session debriefing discussions:

**Past:** What happened during the session?
**Results:** What was achieved during the session?
**Obstacles:** What got in the way of good testing?
**Outlook:** What still needs to be done?
**Feelings:** How does the tester feel about the work?

#### 4. Session Management Guidelines
Operational guidance for effective session execution:

**Session Scope and Timing:**
- Duration guidelines (60-90 minute focus sessions)
- Time-boxing and break management
- Session preparation and setup

**Documentation Efficiency:**
- Note-taking during vs. after testing
- Balancing documentation with discovery
- Template usage flexibility

**Charter Management:**
- When and how to deviate from charter
- Charter modification and documentation
- Creating follow-up charters

**Quality Standards:**
- Bug reporting criteria and standards
- Appropriate investigation depth
- Session evaluation criteria

### Template Design Principles

#### Practical Usability
- Templates should aid, not hinder, good testing
- Minimize administrative overhead
- Focus on value-generating activities
- Scalable formality based on context

#### Information Quality
- Capture essential information for management and improvement
- Enable effective debriefing and coaching
- Support project reporting needs
- Maintain historical record for process improvement

#### Process Integration
- Fit within overall test strategy and project workflow
- Support both solo and team testing scenarios
- Enable aggregation and analysis of session data
- Facilitate communication with stakeholders

### Customization Guidance

#### For Solo Testers
- Simplified debrief process (self-assessment)
- Focus on learning and improvement
- Minimal bureaucracy while maintaining discipline
- Emphasis on skill development

#### For Teams
- Structured debrief meetings
- Coaching and knowledge sharing opportunities
- Consistent reporting and tracking
- Coordination and delegation support

#### For Different Contexts
- **Rapid/Agile:** Minimal documentation, fast feedback
- **Regulated:** Enhanced documentation, audit trail
- **Consulting:** Client communication focus
- **Research:** Deep investigation and analysis

### Quality Criteria for Templates

#### Effectiveness
- Templates support good testing and discovery
- Administrative burden proportionate to value
- Enable clear communication of testing status
- Support continuous improvement

#### Efficiency  
- Quick to complete during and after sessions
- Easy to review and analyze
- Minimal training required
- Adaptable to different contexts

#### Completeness
- Capture all essential session information
- Support various types of testing activities
- Enable proper session evaluation
- Provide historical record

### Reference Standards
Base templates on:
- Session-Based Test Management methodology (James Bach, Jonathan Bach)
- Rapid Software Testing principles
- Context-Driven Testing school practices
- Industry best practices for exploratory testing documentation

### Output Format
Generate complete template set including:
- Session sheet template with all required sections
- Debrief checklist for quality validation
- PROOF agenda for structured debriefing
- Implementation guidelines and usage notes
- Customization suggestions for different contexts

## Example Usage
```
Create SBTM templates for:
- Context: [Solo/Team testing, formality level]
- Project Type: [Agile/Waterfall/Consulting/Research]
- Experience Level: [Junior/Senior testers]
- Reporting Needs: [Internal/Client/Regulatory]
- Session Style: [Pure exploratory/Mixed/Investigative]
```

## Key Success Factors
- Templates enable effective session recording without administrative burden
- Debrief process supports learning and improvement
- Documentation scales appropriately to context
- Templates facilitate good testing rather than hindering it
- Information captured supports project and process needs
