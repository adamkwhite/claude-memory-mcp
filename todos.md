## Low Priority - Enhancements

- [x] **Fix GitHub Actions coverage reporting**
  - Updated CI to run all tests instead of just test_100_percent_coverage.py
  - SonarCloud coverage should now match local 93.96% instead of 70.9%
  - Verified that test_100_percent_coverage.py serves unique purpose for edge cases
- [ ] **Monitor SonarQube quality gate status after latest fixes**
  - Verify all quality gates are now passing
  - Confirm coverage metrics are accurate with archive/scripts exclusions
  - Check that all recent fixes resolved the "8 Issues > 0" condition
- [x] **Consider improving test coverage from 80.2% to 85%+**
  - Current: 90.75% coverage (improved from 80.2%)
  - Target: 85%+ for better code reliability ✅ ACHIEVED
  - Focus on testing edge cases and error handling paths
- [ ] **Achieve 100% test coverage**
  - Current: 94.29% coverage (improved from 93.96%)
  - Target: 100% for complete code reliability
  - Missing coverage areas:
    - conversation_memory.py: 18 lines (153-159, 169-186, 205, 353-354)
    - server_fastmcp.py: 26 lines (reduced from 29 with logging implementation)
    - validators.py: 1 line
  - Required tests:
    - Security validation errors (path traversal, home directory validation)
    - Search edge cases (empty results, malformed data, file corruption)
    - Exception handling paths (permission errors, invalid JSON)
    - All code branches and error conditions
- [ ] Implement conversation data encryption for security
- [ ] Add caching strategy for file I/O operations to improve performance
- [ ] Migrate from JSON files to SQLite database for better performance and indexing
- [ ] Clean up project structure - consolidate duplicate scripts and remove archive files
- [ ] **Consider refactoring test_100_percent_coverage.py** (future improvement)
  - File is essential and should be kept for edge case testing
  - Could potentially split into focused modules: test_error_handling.py, test_edge_cases.py, test_mcp_tools.py
  - Current organization is functional and serves its purpose well
