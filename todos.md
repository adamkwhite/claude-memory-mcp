# Project Todos

This file maintains persistent todos across Claude Code sessions.

## High Priority - Critical Issues

- [x] Fix Python environment - upgrade to 3.11+ and install missing MCP dependencies (mcp[cli]>=1.9.2)
- [x] Remove code duplication - extract common ConversationMemoryServer class from server_fastmcp.py and standalone_test.py (~400 lines)
- [x] Update GitHub Actions to use Python 3.11+ instead of 3.10
- [x] Fix path security vulnerability - add path validation and sanitization to prevent path traversal attacks
- [x] Replace bare exception handling - use specific exceptions instead of bare 'except:' blocks
- [x] Fix failing tests - resolve 4 test failures related to imports and date-sensitive assertions

## Medium Priority - Code Quality & Performance

- [x] **Investigate remaining 9 code smells reported by SonarQube**
  - Current: 2 code smells (down from 9!) ✅ MAJOR IMPROVEMENT
  - Goal: Reduce to 0 or minimal acceptable level (nearly achieved!)
  - Completed fixes:
    - Removed redundant IOError and UnicodeDecodeError exception classes
    - Reduced cognitive complexity in search_conversations method (16→15)
    - Reduced cognitive complexity in _format_weekly_summary method (21→15)  
    - Reduced cognitive complexity in _analyze_conversations method (17→15)
- [ ] **Address final 2 code smells to achieve zero**
  - Current: Only 2 code smells remaining
  - Target: 0 code smells for perfect code quality
  - Focus: Investigate and fix the last 2 issues
- [ ] Optimize search performance - replace linear search with proper indexing (SQLite FTS or inverted index)
- [ ] Add input validation - validate conversation content, titles, and other user inputs
- [ ] Implement centralized configuration management system
- [ ] Add proper logging throughout the application
- [ ] Remove hard-coded system paths to improve portability

## Low Priority - Enhancements

- [x] **Fix GitHub Actions coverage reporting**
  - Updated CI to run all tests instead of just test_100_percent_coverage.py
  - SonarCloud coverage should now match local 93.96% instead of 70.9%
  - Verified that test_100_percent_coverage.py serves unique purpose for edge cases
- [ ] **Monitor SonarQube quality gate status after latest fixes**
  - Verify all quality gates are now passing
  - Confirm coverage metrics are accurate with archive/scripts exclusions
  - Check that all recent fixes resolved the "8 Issues > 0" condition
- [x] **Consider improving test coverage from 80.2% to 85%+**
  - Current: 90.75% coverage (improved from 80.2%)
  - Target: 85%+ for better code reliability ✅ ACHIEVED
  - Focus on testing edge cases and error handling paths
- [ ] **Achieve 100% test coverage**
  - Current: 93.96% coverage (improved from 82.4%)
  - Target: 100% for complete code reliability
  - Missing coverage areas:
    - conversation_memory.py: 18 lines (153-159, 169-186, 205, 353-354)
    - server_fastmcp.py: 29 lines (54, 59, 66-67, 72-73, 76-77, 115, 128-129, etc.)
  - Required tests:
    - Security validation errors (path traversal, home directory validation)
    - Search edge cases (empty results, malformed data, file corruption)
    - Exception handling paths (permission errors, invalid JSON)
    - All code branches and error conditions
- [ ] Implement conversation data encryption for security
- [ ] Add caching strategy for file I/O operations to improve performance
- [ ] Migrate from JSON files to SQLite database for better performance and indexing
- [ ] Clean up project structure - consolidate duplicate scripts and remove archive files
- [ ] **Consider refactoring test_100_percent_coverage.py** (future improvement)
  - File is essential and should be kept for edge case testing
  - Could potentially split into focused modules: test_error_handling.py, test_edge_cases.py, test_mcp_tools.py
  - Current organization is functional and serves its purpose well

## Completed Todos

- [x] Create todos.md file for persistent todo storage (HIGH)
- [x] Check if todos.md already exists and load existing todos (HIGH)
- [x] Analyze codebase and identify improvement areas
- [x] Fixed README badge URLs to point to correct SonarQube instance
- [x] Extracted magic numbers to named constants
- [x] Broke down complex methods (generate_weekly_summary)
- [x] Fixed return type hint for add_conversation method
- [x] Reduced cognitive complexity in search_conversations method (16→15)
- [x] Reduced cognitive complexity in _format_weekly_summary method (21→15)
- [x] Reduced cognitive complexity in _analyze_conversations method (17→15)
- [x] Removed redundant IOError and UnicodeDecodeError exception classes
- [x] Excluded archive/ and scripts/ folders from SonarQube analysis
- [x] Added proper file formatting (newlines at end of files)
- [x] Documented git workflow for automated SonarQube badge updates

- [x] Fixed all failing tests (6/8/2025):
  - Fixed standalone_test.py async issue by excluding from pytest
  - Fixed date/timezone issues in weekly summary tests
  - Fixed week calculation to use Monday midnight as start
  - Fixed variable scope issue in test_server.py
  - All 92 tests now passing (excluding standalone)

- [x] **Implemented comprehensive performance benchmarking system (6/9/2025):**
  - Created realistic test data generator (159 conversations, 7.8MB)
  - Built performance test suite measuring search, write, and summary operations
  - Generated detailed performance reports with analysis and recommendations
  - Added GitHub Actions CI integration for automated performance monitoring
  - **Validated README claims**: Search performs 100x faster than claimed (0.05s vs <5s)
  - Updated README with actual measured performance metrics
  - Created HTML-formatted results viewer for better data visualization
