# Testing Framework for Claude Conversation Memory MCP Server

A comprehensive testing framework based on established methodologies including Heuristic Test Strategy Model (HTSM), Session-Based Test Management (SBTM), and Rapid Software Testing (RST).

## üéØ **Overview**

This testing framework provides both **strategic guidance** and **practical tools** for validating the Claude Conversation Memory MCP Server. The approach balances **exploratory discovery** with **systematic coverage**, focusing on the risks that matter most for a personal conversation storage system.

### **Key Principles**
- **Risk-based prioritization** - Focus effort on security and compatibility risks
- **Session-based management** - Organized, time-boxed exploratory testing  
- **Methodology-driven** - Based on proven testing frameworks (HTSM, SBTM, RST)
- **Practical execution** - Designed for solo testing with ~6 hours total effort

## üéØ **Testing Approach**

### **Risk-Based Priorities**

**HIGH PRIORITY (Must Test)**
- **Security & Data Protection** - Personal conversation data exposure risks
- **FastMCP Integration** - Claude Desktop compatibility and protocol compliance

**MEDIUM PRIORITY (Should Test)**  
- **Core Functionality** - Search, storage, and summary features
- **Edge Cases & Error Handling** - Boundary conditions and recovery

**LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Test)**
- **Performance & Scale** - Response times and capacity limits

### **Testing Methodology**

**Primary Approach: Session-Based Test Management (SBTM)**
- Time-boxed exploratory sessions (60-90 minutes)

**Supporting Approach: Structured Test Procedures**
- Step-by-step validation for critical areas
- Systematic coverage of security vulnerabilities
- Protocol compliance verification
- Reproducible test scenarios

### **Quality Criteria Focus**

Based on HTSM analysis, testing emphasizes:
- **Security** (HIGH) - File system security, data exposure prevention
- **Compatibility** (CRITICAL) - FastMCP protocol compliance, Claude Desktop integration
