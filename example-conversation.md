# MCP Server Development Discussion

**Human**: I want to build an MCP server that stores my Claude conversations locally. How should I structure this?

**Claude**: Great idea! Here's how I'd structure a conversation memory MCP server:

## Core Components

1. **Storage System**: Use a local file system with date-based folders
   ```
   ~/claude-memory/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ conversations/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 01-january/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.json
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ topics.json
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ summaries/
   ```

2. **MCP Tools**: You'll need these essential tools:
   - `search_conversations`: Find relevant past discussions
   - `add_conversation`: Store new conversations
   - `generate_weekly_summary`: Create periodic summaries

3. **Topic Extraction**: Automatically identify topics from conversations using keyword matching

## Implementation Approach

```python
class ConversationMemoryServer:
    def __init__(self, storage_path):
        self.storage_path = Path(storage_path).expanduser()
        # Initialize directory structure
        
    async def search_conversations(self, query, limit=5):
        # Search through stored conversations
        # Return relevance-scored results
        
    async def add_conversation(self, content, title=None):
        # Store conversation with metadata
        # Update indexes
```

**Human**: How should I handle the search functionality? I want it to be fast but also relevant.

**Claude**: For the search functionality, I recommend a multi-layer approach:

## Search Strategy

1. **Index-Based Search**: Maintain a JSON index with metadata
   - Topics per conversation
   - Keywords and phrases
   - Date ranges
   - Quick metadata lookups

2. **Relevance Scoring**:
   ```python
   def calculate_relevance(query_terms, conversation):
       score = 0
       # Topic matches (higher weight)
       for term in query_terms:
           if term in conversation['topics']:
               score += 3
       
       # Content matches
       content = load_conversation_content(conversation['file_path'])
       for term in query_terms:
           score += content.lower().count(term)
       
       return score
   ```

3. **Preview Generation**: Show context around matched terms
   - Extract 2-3 lines before and after matches
   - Limit preview to ~500 characters
   - Highlight relevance

## Performance Optimizations

- Keep index in memory for repeated searches
- Cache frequently accessed conversations
- Use simple keyword matching initially (can upgrade to semantic search later)

**Human**: What about weekly summaries? How should I structure those?

**Claude**: Weekly summaries are perfect for reflection and planning! Here's my recommended approach:

## Summary Structure

```markdown
# Weekly Summary: Week of January 13, 2025

**Period:** 2025-01-13 to 2025-01-19
**Conversations:** 12

## Implementation Tips

1. **Content Analysis**: Look for keywords that indicate:
   - Coding tasks: "code", "function", "class", "git"
   - Decisions: "decided", "chosen", "recommendation"
   - Learning: "learn", "tutorial", "explain"

2. **Automated Categorization**: Parse conversation content to identify:
   - Project work vs. learning
   - Technical discussions vs. planning
   - Completed tasks vs. ongoing work

3. **Storage**: Save summaries in `~/claude-memory/summaries/weekly/`

This gives you a structured way to review your progress and identify patterns in your learning and development work.

**Human**: Perfect! This gives me a solid foundation to start building. Let me implement this step by step.

**Claude**: Excellent plan! Here's a suggested implementation timeline:

## Implementation Phases

**Phase 1 (25 min)**: Basic MCP Server
- Set up server structure
- Implement conversation storage
- Basic file organization

**Phase 2 (25 min)**: Search Functionality  
- Build search algorithm
- Create relevance scoring
- Test with sample data

**Phase 3 (25 min)**: Weekly Summaries
- Implement summary generation
- Add content analysis
- Create summary templates

**Phase 4 (25 min)**: Integration & Testing
- Configure Claude Desktop connection
- End-to-end testing
- Documentation

## Quick Start Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic file storage and simple keyword search
2. **Test Early**: Create test conversations to validate your approach
3. **Iterate**: Add sophistication gradually based on real usage

Good luck with the implementation! This should give you a powerful conversation memory system that grows more valuable over time.
