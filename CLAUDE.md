## Project Structure

**As of June 2025, the project uses a consolidated data/ directory structure:**

```
claude-memory-mcp/
├── data/                    # Consolidated application data
│   ├── conversations/       # Local conversation storage  
│   ├── summaries/          # Weekly summary storage
│   └── config/             # Project configuration files
├── pyproject.toml          # Symlink to data/config/pyproject.toml
├── pytest.ini             # Symlink to data/config/pytest.ini
├── src/                    # Source code
├── tests/                  # Test suite
└── docs/                   # Documentation
```

**Backward Compatibility**: The ConversationMemoryServer automatically detects whether to use the new `data/` structure or legacy structure for existing installations.

**External Storage**: Claude Desktop integration still uses `~/claude-memory/` (outside project) for user conversation storage.

## Python Version Management

This project uses **Python 3.11** to match the CI environment, but the local system defaults to Python 3.8.10.

### Available Python Versions
- `python3` → Python 3.8.10 (system default)
- `python3.11` → Python 3.11.12 (preferred for this project)

### Recommended Commands

Always use `python3.11` explicitly for consistency with CI:

```bash
# Run tests
python3.11 -m pytest tests/test_100_percent_coverage.py --cov=src --cov-report=xml

# Install dependencies 
python3.11 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run server
python3.11 src/server_fastmcp.py

# Create virtual environment with Python 3.11
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### SonarCloud Quality Gate

Recent fixes applied to resolve code quality issues:
- ✅ Replaced bare except clauses with specific exception types
- ✅ Removed unused import statements
- ✅ Extracted magic numbers to named constants
- ✅ Broke down complex methods (generate_weekly_summary)
- ✅ Added path validation for security
- ✅ Migrated from self-hosted SonarQube to SonarCloud for public visibility
- ✅ Fixed return type hint for add_conversation method
- ✅ Reduced cognitive complexity in search_conversations method
- ✅ Excluded archive/ and scripts/ folders from code analysis
- ✅ Added proper file formatting (newlines at end of files)

**SonarCloud Configuration:**
- Organization: adamkwhite
- Project Key: adamkwhite_claude-memory-mcp
- Dashboard: https://sonarcloud.io/summary/overall?id=adamkwhite_claude-memory-mcp
- Exclusions: `tests/**,**/*test*.py,**/test_*.py,**/*benchmark*.py,**/*performance*.py,scripts/**,**/__pycache__/**,htmlcov/**,archive/**,examples/**,docs/generated/**,benchmark_results/**`

**Current Test Coverage: 98.68%** | Duplications: **7%**

**Coverage Milestones Achieved:**
- ✅ **conversation_memory.py**: 100% coverage
- ✅ **exceptions.py**: 100% coverage  
- 🎯 **Total Project**: 98.68% coverage (11 lines remaining)
- 📈 **Progress**: Achieved near-perfect coverage

**SonarCloud Exclusion Workflow:**
When creating new files, automatically check if they need SonarCloud coverage analysis:

**Files that DON'T need coverage (auto-exclude):**
- Tests: `tests/*`, `test_*.py`, `*_test.py`, `*benchmark*.py`, `*performance*.py`
- Scripts: `scripts/*`, `*.sh`, utility files  
- Generated: `docs/generated/*`, `benchmark_results/*`
- Examples: `examples/*`
- Build artifacts: `build/*`, `dist/*`, `__pycache__/*`

**Process:**
1. Before creating files, identify if they need coverage analysis
2. If not, immediately update sonar-project.properties exclusions
3. Use descriptive naming that fits existing exclusion patterns
4. **Update ALL GitHub workflow actions** that run tests to exclude non-coverage files
5. Commit exclusion updates with main file changes
6. This prevents coverage drops and eliminates reactive fixes

**GitHub Workflow Update Requirements:**
When adding exclusions, also update these workflow files:
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` - Main coverage workflow (exclude from `--ignore` in pytest)
- `.github/workflows/performance.yml` - Performance testing (runs separately)
- Any other workflows running pytest with coverage

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Use Python 3.11 for this project
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
pip install pytest pytest-cov pytest-asyncio
```

## Testing Strategy

**Test Suite Organization:**
- `test_100_percent_coverage.py` - Essential for edge cases, error handling, and security validation. DO NOT remove.
- `test_memory_server.py` - Functional testing of core memory server features
- `test_direct_coverage.py` - Direct testing of server components
- `test_fastmcp_coverage.py` - FastMCP-specific functionality testing
- `test_server.py` - Integration testing of complete server functionality
- `standalone_test.py` - Manual test script (excluded from pytest)

**Coverage Monitoring:**
- Local: Run `pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/standalone_test.py --cov=src --cov-report=term`
- CI: GitHub Actions runs all tests and reports to SonarCloud
- Target: 90%+ coverage maintained through layered testing approach

**PR Quality Gate Enforcement:**
- All PRs trigger GitHub Actions workflow with SonarCloud analysis
- PRs are blocked if tests fail or SonarCloud quality gate fails
- Quality gate enforces: Coverage on New Code ≥ 90%
- Failed quality gates prevent PR merging (requires branch protection rules)
- This ensures all new code meets quality standards before merge

## Git Workflow

**MANDATORY:** This repository has branch protection rules that REQUIRE pull requests for all changes to main:

### **Standard Development Workflow (REQUIRED):**
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch (ALWAYS REQUIRED - even for documentation changes)
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 2. Make changes and commit
git add <files>
git commit -m "descriptive message"

# 3. **MANDATORY: Run full test suite after major changes**
# Activate virtual environment and run tests
source claude-memory-mcp-venv/bin/activate
python -m pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/standalone_test.py --cov=src --cov-report=term -v

# 4. Push branch to GitHub (NEVER push directly to main)
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# 5. Open Pull Request on GitHub
# - ALWAYS mention @claude in PR body or comments for review
# - PR triggers automated testing and SonarCloud analysis
# - Must pass all quality gates before merge is allowed
# - Coverage on new code must be ≥ 90%

# 6. Merge PR (only after quality gates pass)
# - Tests must pass ✅
# - SonarCloud quality gate must pass ✅
# - PR conversations must be resolved ✅
```

### **CRITICAL: No Direct Pushes to Main**
- ❌ **ALL direct pushes to main are BLOCKED** - even for simple documentation updates
- ❌ **Force pushes are BLOCKED** 
- ❌ **Quality gate failures block merges**
- ✅ **EVERY change must go through feature branch + PR process**
- ⚠️ **This applies to todos.md, README.md, and ALL files without exception**

### **Quality Gate Requirements:**
- All tests must pass
- SonarCloud analysis must pass
- Coverage on new code ≥ 90%
- No unresolved PR conversations
- Linear history maintained

**Note:** Even repository owners cannot bypass these rules - this ensures enterprise-grade quality standards.

### **Mandatory Testing Requirements**

**ALWAYS run full test suite for these changes:**
- Any code changes to `src/` directory
- Directory structure modifications
- Configuration file updates (`pyproject.toml`, `pytest.ini`)
- Database schema changes
- API endpoint modifications
- New feature implementations
- Bug fixes involving core functionality

**Testing Command (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```bash
source claude-memory-mcp-venv/bin/activate && python -m pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/standalone_test.py --cov=src --cov-report=term -v
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All tests must pass (191/191 or more)
- ✅ Coverage should be ≥ 94% (current baseline)
- ✅ No failing tests before creating PR

**If tests fail:**
1. Fix failing tests immediately
2. Re-run test suite until all pass
3. Only then proceed with PR creation

This prevents back-and-forth in PRs due to test failures.

### **⚠️ CRITICAL: Lessons Learned from Process Failures**

**Based on SQLite FTS Search Optimization implementation (June 2025), the following workflow violations caused significant impact:**

**NEVER DO THIS:**
- ❌ Skip local testing before commits ("I'll test in CI/CD")
- ❌ Push changes without running full test suite first
- ❌ Create reactive "fix-as-we-go" PRs with multiple failure cycles
- ❌ Submit PRs before validating compatibility with existing systems
- ❌ Ignore async compatibility analysis for major changes

**CONSEQUENCES OF WORKFLOW VIOLATIONS:**
- **Technical Impact**: 64+ test failures, hours of reactive debugging
- **Team Impact**: Multiple back-and-forth cycles, wasted review time
- **Process Impact**: CI/CD pipeline blocked, delayed other features
- **Quality Impact**: Reactive fixes instead of systematic solutions

**MANDATORY PREVENTIVE MEASURES:**
1. **Pre-Commit Validation**: ALWAYS run local test suite before first commit
2. **Compatibility Analysis**: Plan async/breaking changes before implementation
3. **Script Dependencies**: Test all supporting scripts locally before CI/CD
4. **Systematic Approach**: Complete planning phase before coding phase
5. **Zero-Defect PRs**: Only submit PRs after local validation passes

**ACCOUNTABILITY:**
- Local testing is **NON-NEGOTIABLE** - no exceptions for "minor" changes
- "Speed over quality" approach is **explicitly prohibited**
- Process shortcuts that create technical debt are **unacceptable**
- Reactive debugging in PRs indicates **insufficient upfront planning**

### **📋 PRE-COMMIT CHECKLIST (MANDATORY)**

**Before making ANY commit to ANY branch:**

- [ ] **1. Run Full Test Suite Locally**
  ```bash
  source claude-memory-mcp-venv/bin/activate && python -m pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/standalone_test.py --cov=src --cov-report=term -v
  ```
- [ ] **2. Verify All Tests Pass** (expect 417+ passing tests)
- [ ] **3. Check Coverage Baseline** (expect ≥76% coverage)
- [ ] **4. Test Supporting Scripts** (if modified any scripts/ files)
- [ ] **5. Validate Async Compatibility** (if modified async methods)
- [ ] **6. Run SonarCloud Analysis** (triggered automatically on PR)
- [ ] **7. Document Breaking Changes** (if any API changes)

**Before creating ANY Pull Request:**

- [ ] **8. Re-run Full Test Suite** (final validation)
- [ ] **9. Review All Changed Files** (ensure no debug code, console.log, etc.)
- [ ] **10. Write Descriptive PR Description** (what, why, how, testing done)
- [ ] **11. Self-Review Changes** (would you approve this PR?)
- [ ] **12. Verify No Merge Conflicts** (rebase if needed)

**⚠️ ZERO TOLERANCE:** Committing without completing this checklist violates workflow standards and creates technical debt.

**GitHub Actions Workflow Notes:**
- ✅ **Migrated to SonarCloud**: Public code quality dashboard with automatic PR decoration
- **Two build phases**: PR testing (cannot push) + post-merge execution (can push badges)
- **Badge updates**: SonarCloud badges auto-update from cloud platform
- **PR builds**: Test code without attempting repository modifications

## Implementation Details

### Universal Memory Architecture
The system uses a pluggable importer architecture where each AI platform has a dedicated importer class inheriting from `BaseImporter`:

- **BaseImporter**: Abstract base defining universal conversation format
- **Format Detection**: Automatic platform recognition with confidence scoring
- **Schema Validation**: JSON schemas ensure data integrity and compatibility
- **Universal Format**: Standardized internal representation for cross-platform compatibility

### Key Design Decisions
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing Claude conversations remain fully functional
- **Privacy-First Development**: Tools for sanitizing real export data for testing
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy addition of new AI platforms
- **Performance-Optimized**: SQLite FTS5 for sub-3ms search times

## Next Steps

**Immediate Priorities (Next Session):**
1. **Test Additional Platforms** - Validate Cursor/Claude importers with real export data
2. **Complete Schema Validation** - Finish JSON schemas for all supported platforms
3. **FastMCP Integration** - Wire up importers to MCP server with new tools
4. **End-to-End Testing** - Full import pipeline validation and performance benchmarking

**Medium-Term Goals:**
- Real-time platform integrations (ChatGPT API, Cursor sessions)
- Advanced search features (date filtering, semantic search)
- Multi-user support and workspace isolation
- Cross-platform conversation sync and merging
