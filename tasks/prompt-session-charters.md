# Prompt: Session Charter Generation

## Purpose
Generate focused session charters for exploratory testing using Session-Based Test Management (SBTM) methodology.

## Instructions
You are an expert tester familiar with Session-Based Test Management and exploratory testing techniques. Create session charters that guide focused, time-boxed exploratory testing sessions.

### Required Inputs
Before generating session charters, gather this information:
1. **Product/Feature Description** - What system/feature is being tested
2. **Risk Areas** - Priority risk areas from test strategy or risk analysis
3. **Quality Criteria Focus** - Which quality aspects are most important
4. **Session Duration** - Typical session length (60-90 minutes recommended)
5. **Tester Skill Level** - Experience level of testers who will execute sessions
6. **Test Environment** - Available tools, test data, setup requirements

### Charter Structure
Generate individual session charters with these components:

#### Charter Header
- **Session Title** - Clear, descriptive name
- **Priority Level** - HIGH/CRITICAL/MEDIUM/LOW based on risk
- **Duration** - Target session length (60-90 minutes typical)

#### Charter Statement
- **Mission** - Clear statement of what the session aims to accomplish
- **Areas to Test** - Specific product areas, features, or risk areas to explore
- **Key Risk Questions** - Important questions the session should answer

#### Setup Requirements
- **Test Environment** - Required setup and configuration
- **Test Data** - Specific data, files, or scenarios needed
- **Tools/Resources** - Required tools, documentation, or access

#### Test Strategy Tags
Reference which test techniques to emphasize:
- Function Testing (test what it can do)
- Domain Testing (boundary values, data partitioning)
- Stress Testing (overwhelm the product)
- Flow Testing (sequences of operations)
- Scenario Testing (realistic user stories)
- Claims Testing (verify requirements/documentation)
- User Testing (realistic usage patterns)
- Risk Testing (explore specific vulnerabilities)

### Charter Design Principles
- **Focused Mission** - Each charter should have a clear, specific objective
- **Time-Boxed** - Designed to be completed in 60-90 minutes
- **Risk-Driven** - Prioritize charters based on product risk analysis
- **Executable** - Provide enough detail for tester to begin immediately
- **Flexible** - Allow for exploration and discovery beyond strict charter bounds

### Charter Categories
Create charters across these typical categories:

#### High-Priority Charters (Must Execute)
- Critical risk areas identified in test strategy
- Core functionality that must work for product success
- Integration points and compatibility requirements

#### Medium-Priority Charters (Should Execute)
- Important feature areas with moderate risk
- Edge cases and error handling scenarios
- Performance and usability validation

#### Low-Priority Charters (Nice to Execute)
- Advanced features with lower risk
- Performance optimization areas
- Enhancement and improvement opportunities

### Quality Guidelines
Each charter should:
- **Address Specific Risks** - Target identified product risks
- **Be Independently Executable** - Not depend on other sessions
- **Include Stopping Heuristics** - Guidance on when session is complete
- **Provide Investigation Guidance** - Suggest specific techniques or approaches
- **Allow for Opportunity Testing** - Room for unplanned discovery

### Charter Flexibility Notes
- Charters are guidelines, not rigid scripts
- Testers should follow interesting bugs even if off-charter
- Charter can be modified during session if needed
- Document any charter deviations in session notes

### Reference Materials
Base charters on these methodologies:
- Session-Based Test Management by James Bach and Jonathan Bach
- Rapid Software Testing exploratory techniques
- Heuristic Test Strategy Model for risk-based prioritization
- General test techniques from HTSM

### Output Format
Generate 3-7 session charters depending on scope:
- Markdown format with consistent structure
- Clear priority levels and time estimates
- Actionable setup and execution guidance
- Include total estimated effort across all sessions

## Example Usage
```
Create session charters for [PRODUCT/FEATURE]:
- System: [Description of what's being tested]
- Priority Risks: [Top 3-5 risk areas to address]
- Session Length: [Preferred duration, typically 60-90 minutes]
- Tester Profile: [Junior/Senior, domain expertise]
- Available Time: [Total hours available for testing]
```

## Key Success Factors
- Each charter addresses specific, important risks
- Charters are executable within stated time constraints
- Setup requirements are clear and achievable
- Risk questions guide meaningful exploration
- Total effort fits available testing time
- Charters build on each other logically
