# Test Strategy: Claude Conversation Memory MCP Server

## Overview

This test strategy guides testing of the Claude Conversation Memory MCP Server, a local storage and retrieval system that enables continuity across Claude chat sessions through three main tools: `search_conversations`, `add_conversation`, and `generate_weekly_summary`.

## Risk Assessment & Test Focus

Based on HTSM quality criteria analysis and business priorities:

### HIGH PRIORITY RISKS

**Security (Critical Business Risk)**
- **File path injection/traversal**: Malicious file paths could access system files outside storage directory
- **JSON injection**: Malformed conversation content could corrupt index files
- **Data exposure**: Personal conversation data accidentally included in logs or error messages
- **Directory permissions**: Incorrect permissions could expose private conversations

**Compatibility (Critical Functional Risk)**
- **FastMCP protocol compliance**: Tool signatures, parameter validation, response formats
- **Claude Desktop integration**: Tool discovery, execution, error handling
- **WSL file system compatibility**: Path handling between Windows/Linux environments

### MEDIUM PRIORITY RISKS

**Reliability (Important for User Trust)**
- **Index corruption**: JSON files becoming unreadable due to concurrent access or partial writes
- **File system failures**: Disk full, permission errors, directory creation failures
- **Date parsing errors**: Invalid date formats causing conversation storage failures
- **Search accuracy**: Poor relevance scoring returning irrelevant results

**Performance (User Experience)**
- **Search response time**: Must be reasonable (user requirement: "can't be forever")
- **Large dataset handling**: Performance degradation with hundreds of conversations
- **Memory usage**: Efficient handling of conversation content during search

### LOWER PRIORITY RISKS

**Usability**
- **Error message clarity**: Users can understand and act on errors
- **Topic extraction accuracy**: Relevant topics identified from conversations

## Test Strategy

### Testing Approach
- **Exploratory Testing**: Primary approach using session-based test management
- **Risk-Based Focus**: Prioritize security and compatibility testing
- **Single Tester**: All testing performed by system owner (Adam)
- **Time Box**: Few hours total across multiple 60-90 minute sessions

### Product Elements Coverage

**Structure**
- FastMCP server implementation (`server_fastmcp.py`)
- File system storage structure (`~/claude-memory/`)
- JSON index files (`index.json`, `topics.json`)
- Configuration and dependencies

**Functions**  
- `search_conversations(query, limit)` - Core search functionality
- `add_conversation(content, title, date)` - Storage and indexing
- `generate_weekly_summary(week_offset)` - Analysis and reporting
- Internal functions: topic extraction, indexing, preview generation

**Data**
- Conversation content (markdown format)
- Search queries and results
- Date handling and parsing
- JSON index data integrity
- File paths and naming conventions

**Interfaces**
- FastMCP protocol compliance
- Claude Desktop tool integration
- File system operations
- Error reporting and logging

**Platform**
- Ubuntu 20.04 WSL environment
- Claude Desktop client
- Python 3.8+ runtime
- File system permissions and storage

**Operations**
- Normal usage patterns (search, add, summarize)
- Edge cases (empty queries, missing files, corrupt data)
- Error conditions (permission denied, disk full)
- Concurrent operations

### Test Techniques

**Risk Testing**: Focus on security vulnerabilities and data exposure
**Stress Testing**: Large datasets, concurrent operations, boundary conditions  
**Flow Testing**: End-to-end workflows without resetting state
**Claims Testing**: Verify against PRD functional requirements
**Domain Testing**: Boundary values for dates, file sizes, search terms
**User Testing**: Realistic usage scenarios and workflows

### Test Environment

**Setup Requirements**
- Ubuntu 20.04 WSL with claude-memory-mcp code
- Claude Desktop with MCP server configured and running
- Test conversation data for realistic scenarios
- File system monitoring tools for security testing

**Test Data Needs**
- Sample conversation files (various sizes, topics, dates)
- Malformed/edge case inputs (invalid dates, special characters)
- Realistic search queries and expected results
- Known good and corrupt JSON index files

## Deliverables

1. **Session Reports**: Session-based test management reports for each testing session
2. **Bug Reports**: Issues found during exploratory testing
3. **Security Assessment**: Specific findings related to data exposure risks
4. **Compatibility Verification**: FastMCP and Claude Desktop integration status
5. **Test Data Artifacts**: Reusable test conversations and scenarios

## Success Criteria

**Immediate (End of Testing)**
- No critical security vulnerabilities found
- FastMCP integration works reliably with Claude Desktop
- Core workflows (search, add, summarize) function correctly
- Performance acceptable for single-user usage

**Go/No-Go Criteria**
- **Go**: Security risks acceptable, core functionality works, no data loss
- **No-Go**: Data exposure risks, integration failures, or reliability issues that prevent basic usage

## Test Sessions Overview

1. **Security & Data Protection** (90 min) - HIGH PRIORITY
2. **FastMCP Integration** (60 min) - CRITICAL  
3. **Core Functionality** (90 min) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
4. **Edge Cases & Error Handling** (60 min) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
5. **Performance & Scale** (60 min) - LOW PRIORITY

Total estimated effort: ~6 hours across 5 focused sessions
